## About the Collection
The Allegheny Observatory has been an important resource for University of Pittsburgh students interested in learning more about astronomy. Over the past 25 years this institution has hosted a variety of educational events and tours for university students and the local community alike. This exhibit takes a look at some of the experiences of students and professors and how the observatoryâ€™s resources have been incorporated into courses at the University of Pittsburgh.
